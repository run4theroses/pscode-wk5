// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

  
Enter a number(n)
remainder = n%2
if remainder == 0 
print even
else
print odd
Check: 
Enter any number(n) to test whether it is odd or even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter 5 separate numbers
Read n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
Calculate the average (n1+n2=n3=n4=n5)/5
Write avg

If(n1 < n2)   Set max to n2 
else   Set max to n1 
if(n3 > max)  Set max to n3 
if(n4 > max)   Set max to n4 
if(n5 > max) Set max to n5 
Write "The max is" 
Write max  
if(n1 > n2)   Set min to n2 
else   Set min to n1 
if(n3 < min)   Set min to n3 
if(n4 < min)   Set min to n4 
if(n5 < min) Set min to n5 
Write "The min is" 
Write min
